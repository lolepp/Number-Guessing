Number guessing game with two Python scripts that let the computer try to guess an user given number and also reversed with an user trying to guess a random number.

The computer's guess is based on a randomized binary search algorithm, which is furtherly described in random_search_algorithm.

To run these scripts you just need to have Python installed.
